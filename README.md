# Durak

Durak is a two-part layout for the [ZSA Moonlander Mark I](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/). The first part can be found [here](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/RqMGW/WOwr3/0). The second part is this layout which was made using [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134). The base for this layout is [Dvorak-QWERTY-Ctrl](https://github.com/bradfeehan/Dvorak-QWERTY-Ctrl) by [@bradfeehan](https://github.com/bradfeehan). The only difference is the numbers row which was changed from <kbd>1</kbd><kbd>2</kbd><kbd>3</kbd><kbd>4</kbd><kbd>5</kbd> <kbd>6</kbd><kbd>7</kbd><kbd>8</kbd><kbd>9</kbd><kbd>0</kbd> to <kbd>7</kbd><kbd>5</kbd><kbd>3</kbd><kbd>1</kbd><kbd>9</kbd> <kbd>8</kbd><kbd>0</kbd><kbd>2</kbd><kbd>4</kbd><kbd>6</kbd>. The symbols are also rearranged accordingly, so this layout is not recommended unless both parts are used together.
